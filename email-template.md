**Subject:** HAAS DT-1 High-Speed Drilling & Tapping Center - Ex-Demo, Low Hours

---

Dear [Name],

We are offering a well-maintained **HAAS DT-1** vertical machining center with exceptional provenance and minimal use.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Built:** August 2018 (Serial #1154161)
- **Spindle Hours:** ~500 — remarkably low for its age
- **History:** Former Landré showroom demo unit, used only for prototyping since 2021
- **Service:** Freshly serviced by Landré (December 2025)
- **Included:** Complete set of BT-30 toolholders + Lang precision workholding system

**Machine Specifications:**
- 20" x 16" x 15.5" travels (X/Y/Z)
- 15,000 RPM inline direct-drive spindle
- 20-pocket side-mount tool changer
- High-speed rigid tapping capability
- Intuitive HAAS control with 15" color display

This machine has never seen production — only light prototyping work in a climate-controlled R&D environment. The result: a nearly-new machine at a fraction of the original investment.
